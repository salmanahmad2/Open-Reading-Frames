# Open-Reading-Frames
A program which allows the user to a DNA sequence. Program reads the three reading frames (+1, +2, +3). The code gives output in form of tuples (CODON = 3 Nucleic Acid Bases) for each of these reading frames. Lastly, the program will print 1-Letter Amino Acid abbreviation for each of the printed tuples (CODON).The sequence of amino acids is unique for each type of protein and all proteins are built from the same set of just 20 amino acids for all living things. Instructions in the DNA are first transcribed into RNA and the RNA is then translated into proteins. We can think of DNA, when read as sequences of three letters, as a dictionary of life.

## What will our algorithm Do?
1. Translate the DNA sequence into reading frames.
2. For each of the reading frame, print the nucleotides in the form of CODONS (tuples).

## How it works
Program which allow the user to enter a DNA sequence. Program will read the three reading frames (+1, +2, +3). The code will give output in form of tuples (CODON = 3 Nucleic Acid Bases) for each of these reading frames. Lastly, the program will print 1-Letter Amino Acid abbreviation for each of the printed tuples (CODON).

### Frame (+1):

### Frame (+2):

and so on

3. For a given tuple (CODON), find the unique one letter representation from the table shown below for Amino acids

4. We will compare the CODON with one letter representation of the Amino acid (as shown in the Table above), CODON is compared character by character and if matches the CODON in the table it is displayed.
5. This will form a sequence of Amino acids where each Amino acid is the translation of every tuple (CODON).
